            <p><span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: x-large;">Forcast Report:</span>Today, Chennai is experiencing **heavy rainfall** under an orange alert, with the government advising heightened caution. This alert signals the likelihood of significant rain, possibly reaching **70–100 mm** in certain areas, along with possible thunderstorms. Temperatures are expected to hover between **26°C** and **28°C** during the day, with high humidity levels amplifying the moist atmosphere. Winds from the northeast will bring further rain across the city, with gusts reaching 20–25 km/h.

                The Tamil Nadu government has urged residents to limit non-essential travel and stay indoors where possible, especially in low-lying areas that are prone to flooding. Schools and public buildings are on standby as shelters for those affected. It’s advisable to monitor weather updates and heed local safety advisories to stay prepared for any unexpected shifts in weather conditions.</p>
